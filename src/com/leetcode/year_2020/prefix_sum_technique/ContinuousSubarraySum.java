         * Question says find a subarray of minimum size 2 that sums upto multiples of k.
         *
         * Input: [23, 2, 4, 6, 7],  k=6
         * Output: True
         * Explanation: Because [2, 4] is a continuous subarray of size 2 and sums up to 6.
         *
         * Input: [23, 2, 6, 4, 7],  k=6
         * Output: True
         * Explanation: Because [23, 2, 6, 4, 7] is an continuous subarray of size 5 and sums up to 42.
         *
         * So we can use Prefix Sum Technique, with a twist since question is asking we have to check multiples of k.
         * Let's mod the prefixSum%k to keep them within limit of k.
         * After that we will use Map to check whether a runningSum%k already exist in Map if yes then we should return
         * true.
         *
         * Reason behind this is the Remainder Theorem.
         *  A % X == (A + (n*X)) % X; .... where n = 1 to ......infinity.
         *
         *  Proof:
         *
         *  10 % 6 == (10 + (1*6)) % 6 = 16%6 ==> 4 ==4
         *         == (10 + (2*6)) % 6 = 22%6 ==> 4 ==4
         *         == (10 + (3*6)) % 6 = 28%6 ==> 4 ==4
         *         == (10 + (4*6)) % 6 = 34%6 ==> 4 ==4
         *         == (10 + (8*6)) % 6 = 58%6 ==> 4 ==4
         *
         * For e.g. in case of the array [23,2,6,4,7] the running sum is [23,25,31,35,42] and the
         * remainders are [5,1,1,5,0]. We got remainder 5 at index 0 and at index 3. That means,
         * in between these two indexes we must have added a number which is multiple of the k. Hope this clarifies your doubt :)
