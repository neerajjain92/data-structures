         * If you notice carefully, we can break down this problem into {@link MaximumAreaOfHistogram},
         * how we will convert the 2D array into 1D array. and check the histogram for that.
         *
         * [
         *   ["1","0","1","0","0"],
         *   ["1","0","1","1","1"],
         *   ["1","1","1","1","1"],
         *   ["1","0","0","1","0"]
         * ]
         *
         * So let's start from top-most row. 1*5 matrix into 1d
         * if we put it into 1D histogram then height will become --> 1 0 1 0 0  callHistogramOnIt();
         *
         * Now let's try to include 2nd Row(2*4 matrix into 1d) in this and see how much height we can achieve
         * [2, 0, 2, 1, 1]
         *
         * For Row 3  [3, 1, 3, 2, 2] (3*5 matrix into 1d)
         *
         * Now 4th Row is interesting... we can't do [4,1,3,3,2]
         * Reason : ===> Column 2 building will be in air, since at 4th row height is 0.... similar case for 3rd column.
         * So whenever we encounter 0 .. i.e we can't include height coming from top row.
         * So for this reason the matrix 4*4 in 1d will be [4,0,0,3,0]
